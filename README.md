# atomizify

`atomizify` is a small JavaScript library that generates a bunch of atomic CSS classes.

## How to get it ?

Install the module in your folder:

```
npm i atomizify
```

Import it in your file:

```js
import { atomizify } from 'atomizify'
```

## How to use it ?

`atomizify` can fit all types of developers, from lazy to geekiest ones!
It provides a few options to play with it: set some filters, choose your typecase system, or add your own custom classes.

Choose the profile that suits you the best:

- You're a ready-made lover:
  By default, `atomizify` offers thousands of predefined classes.
  Just call the function, and a whole galaxy of CSS classes appears.

  ```js
  atomizify()
  ```

- You're a less-is-more expert:
  `atomizify` lets you select / unselect the classes of your choice among the predefined sets & generate only the substancial ones.

  ```js
  // you can pass the 'filters' object, which accepts 3 sub-objects: 'sets', 'subsets', 'properties'
  // each sub-object accepts 2 key-value pairs: 'names' and 'to_remove'

  atomizify({
    filters: {
      sets: {
        names: ['layout'], // 'names' is an array containing the names of the targetted items (to keep, or to remove if the prop 'to_remove' is passed to 'true')
      },
      subsets: {
        names: ['dimensions'],
      },
      properties: {
        names: ['min-height', 'min-width'],
        to_remove: true, // set to 'true' if you want to remove the targetted items listed in 'names'
      },
    },
  })
  ```

- You're a custom-all freak:
  `atomizify` gives you complete freedom to create and add your own custom classes.
  You can also personalize the typecase system for your classes' names.

  ```js
  // you can pass the 'custom_classes' object, in which each entry is a key-value pair:
  // the key as the desired class name, and the string value as the desired CSS rule
  // you can also set the 'typecase' string value to choose the formatting of your classes' names

  atomizify({
    typecase: 'dash', // choose among 'snake', 'dash' or 'camel' case ; default is 'snake'
    custom_classes: {
      myclass1: 'background: black; color: turquoise',
      myclass2: 'border-color: pink',
      myclass3: 'font-size: 200px',
    },
  })
  ```

`atomizify` also works with React: it allows you to convert all the generated atomic classes in elegant-as-hell flags, that you can comfortably use & combine to build modular components ; and all of this thanks to [kigiri](https://github.com/kigiri).
To achieve that, you'll have to install his invaluable [dallas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dallas) module as well:

```
npm i dallas
```

All set? Now, you can import the `flagify` function in your React app, and make an unwise use of the `Component` magic:

```js
import { flagify } from 'atomizify'

const { Component } = flagify()

// chain the 'Component' object to every CSS classes you want to apply to your element,
// and finish by calling the type of HTML element you desire (div, span, section, input, etc.)
const Title = Component.fs55.sapphire3.mb40.div()

const App = () => <Title>atomizify</Title> // use your React component as pleases you
```

## How to document it ?

`atomizify` also provides some ready-to-use generated documentation, so you can see at a glance all the magnificent CSS classes that have been generated.

Import & call the desired function(s) in your file:

- If you'd like to display the CSS code generated, be my guest:

```js
import { display_classes } from 'atomizify/doc'

// the 'display_colors' function can be called without argument
// it also accepts the following options, passed in an object: 'node', 'open', 'flattened'

display_classes({
  node: my_html_node, // you can pass a HTML node that will contain the chart ; default is 'document.body'
  open: false, // you can set the initial state of the component displaying the content ; default is 'true'
  flattened: false, // you can display the CSS classes all flattened, without the parents sections (sets, subsets and properties) ; default is 'false'
})
```

- If you'd like to display a chart of the generated colors, suit yourself:

```js
import { display_colors } from 'atomizify/doc'

// the 'display_colors' function can be called without argument
// it also accepts the following options, passed in an object: 'node', 'open', 'circles'

display_colors({
  node: my_html_node, // you can pass a HTML node that will contain the chart ; default is 'document.body'
  open: false, // you can set the initial state of the component displaying the content ; default is 'true'
  circles: false, // you can set the visual shape of the colors as circles ; default is 'false'
})
```

And voil√†!
