# atomify

## What

`atomify` is a JavaScript library generating atomic CSS classes and variables.

`atomify` can fit all types of developers: for lazy ones, it offers a bunch of predefined items, but if you're a custom-freak you can also create and add your own classes!

`atomify` also works with React: it allows you to convert all the generated atomic classes in elegant-as-hell flags, that you can comfortably use & combine to build modular components.
